# Parts

# How to
The Karbox is supposed to be assembled with a Brook Fighting board that have an easy connection (Audio, PS4 Plus, Universal...) https://www.brookaccessory.com/Fighting%20Board/list.html

The connection is soldered, maybe you can desing some double side PCB or something like that, we prefer soldering with this https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4951061

Art can be interchangeable, you have to put on plate and art small magnets https://www.amazon.es/dp/B078W1VY1T?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_SSCSK3G7ZDKYRJVQQZX5
